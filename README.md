# EndEarth - The Game

A small arcade-style game about the pollution of Earth to demonstrate the application of physics-emulating algorithms, written in Processing (Java) within the scope of the "Algorithms for Creative Technology" course of module 4 of the Creative Technology BSc program at the University of Twente.

## Goal of the Game

Delay the rise of pollutions by controlling volcanic rocks to strike emerging cities. 

More and more cities are spawning around the world, slowly increasing the pollution. You lose when the pollution, symbolized by a yellow fog slowly growing over the planet, engulfs the entire earth. As you play, more volcanoes will spawn around the earth, giving you more rocks to redirect onto cities to slow down the inevitable death of a clean atmosphere. You can guide the rocks towards the cities by hovering your mouse near them, which acts as a weak gravitational force to change its natural trajectory. You can also activate a super gravitational force at your cursor by holding down the left mouse button, even temporarily pulling the Earth itself from its trajectory. Use this power to avoid occasional meteor showers from hitting the Earth's surface and decreasing your score.

## Conclusion

Does it make sense? Hardly.
Is it fun. Maybe briefly.
Is it a decent demonstration of using algorithms to achieve a goal? I hope so.
